# File Upload Fix - "No file part in the request" Error

This document explains the changes made to fix the "No file part in the request" error in the Katapult Make Ready Report Generator application.

## What Was Fixed

The "No file part in the request" error occurs when the file upload form submits without the file data being properly attached to the request. The fix addresses several potential issues:

1. **Form Submission Handling**: Modified the JavaScript to ensure the file remains properly attached during form submission.
2. **File Input Visibility**: Changed from `d-none` to `visually-hidden` to improve accessibility and browser handling.
3. **Improved Validation**: Added proper validation checks before submission.
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added robust logging and debugging tools to diagnose upload issues.
5. **Server-Side Logging**: Added detailed request logging on the server side to better understand what's happening.

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Regular Usage**:
   - Simply drag and drop a JSON file or use the "Browse Files" button
   - Click "Generate Report" to process the file

2. **Using the Debug Features**:
   - The debugging panel will now show automatically when selecting a file
   - The "Test Upload" button (new blue button below the main submit button) lets you verify form data without submitting
   - Check browser console for additional logging information

3. **Sample Test File**:
   - A sample JSON file has been provided at `static/test-data/sample.json`
   - You can use this to test the upload without needing a real Katapult file

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter the "No file part in the request" error:

1. **Check the Debugging Panel**:
   - It should show the file details and validation status
   - Look for any specific errors reported

2. **Examine Server Logs**:
   - The Flask application now logs detailed information about incoming requests
   - Check for any messages about missing file parts or malformed requests

3. **Try the Browser's File Input**:
   - If drag-and-drop isn't working, use the "Browse Files" button instead

4. **Test with Different Browsers**:
   - Sometimes file upload issues are browser-specific
   - Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to see if the issue persists

## Technical Details of the Fix

1. **JavaScript Changes**:
   - Modified form submission to prevent premature submission before file attachment
   - Added explicit FormData validation
   - Added comprehensive error checking for file attachment
   - Improved the drag-and-drop implementation

2. **HTML Changes**:
   - Changed file input styling to ensure consistent browser handling
   - Added required attribute to enforce file selection
   - Added debugging interface elements

3. **Server-Side Changes**:
   - Enhanced request logging
   - Added diagnostic endpoint at `/debug-request` (POST) for examining request contents

## How to Use the Debug Tools

1. The debug panel will automatically appear when interacting with the form
2. The "Test Upload" button verifies the form data without submitting
3. You can also use the browser console to run:
   ```javascript
   debugUpload.testUpload();     // Test form data creation
   debugUpload.checkValidity();  // Check form validity
   debugUpload.log("custom message");  // Add custom debug messages
   ```

These changes should resolve the "No file part in the request" error by ensuring proper file attachment and providing better diagnostic information when issues occur.
