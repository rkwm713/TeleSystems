# Uploads and Generated Reports

This `uploads/` directory serves as a temporary storage location for files related to the operation of the Make-Ready Report Generator.

## Purpose

1.  **Storage for User-Uploaded Files**: When a user uploads Katapult JSON or SPIDAcalc JSON files through the web interface, these files may be temporarily stored in this directory during processing by the Flask application.
2.  **Storage for Generated Reports**: After the data processing is complete, the generated Make-Ready Excel reports (e.g., `make_ready_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`) are saved here. The web application then typically provides a download link to these files for the user.

## File Management

*   **Temporary Nature**: The files in this directory are often temporary. Depending on the application's configuration, these files might be:
    *   Cleaned up periodically.
    *   Overwritten by new uploads or reports.
    *   Managed by session if the application supports multiple users or concurrent sessions.
*   **`.gitignore`**: In many development and production environments, this `uploads/` directory (or its contents) would be added to the `.gitignore` file. This is because:
    *   User-specific data and generated outputs are typically not version-controlled with the application's source code.
    *   It prevents the repository from growing unnecessarily large with transient data.
*   **Permissions**: Ensure that the web server process has the necessary read and write permissions for this directory to allow file uploads and report saving.

## Current Contents

This directory may contain:
*   Input JSON files (Katapult, SPIDAcalc) that were uploaded by users.
*   Output `.xlsx` Make-Ready reports generated by the application.

The presence of files like `make_ready_report_*.xlsx` indicates that reports have been successfully generated and stored here.
